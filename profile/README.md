I also host a maven for modded minecraft with focus on 1.7.10. [https://maven.thorfusion.com/artifactory/central/](https://maven.thorfusion.com/artifactory/central/) Several old mavens have gone offline over the years and this is to keep old artifacts available for others and provide as an backup. I even managed to gen an old backup of kcauldron's maven on it. kcauldron.thorfusion.com is the dedicated link.
